<h3>What Should Learners Know about Ed-Tech?</h3>
<br />

<p>In many ways, the resources listed under both the "<a href="http://guide.hackeducation.com/techies.html">Technologists</a>" and "<a href="http://guide.hackeducation.com/edu.html">Teachers</a>" section of this guide are useful for learners. That is, it's worth considering how ed-tech views students just as its worth thinking about how education views students.</p>

<p>Questions students should ask about the ed-tech they're compelled to use include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who owns my data?</li>
<li>Who has access to my data? Who is it shared with</li>
<li>How long is my data stored?</li>
</ul>
